The AI engineer successfully initiated and developed a full-stack e-commerce application for Manira artificial jewelry, starting from scratch. Key milestones include setting up the React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB integration, handling authentication, and implementing core e-commerce functionalities like product display, cart management, and order processing. The development was highly iterative, driven by continuous user feedback, focusing on refining features like the admin dashboard for SKU management, promotions, customer details, and comprehensive order tracking. The engineer consistently addressed bugs, integrated payment solutions (Razorpay), and enhanced UI/UX, including logo refinement and accessibility features like Excel exports for data. The approach prioritized functional implementation and bug resolution, with careful adherence to technical constraints and modern development practices.
